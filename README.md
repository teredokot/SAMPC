### Frequently Asked Questions
1. **Is this using the leaked version of SA-MP 0.2 source?**
	Yes, and I know I absolutely should not use it, even if VCMP's 0.1 source officially released, and especially without any written permission. This project is not meant to harm the world of SA-MP, instead to give players better gaming and/or server owners scripting experience and little bit longer lifespan. As Kalcor/kyeman, the one and only developer of SA-MP stated in November 11, 2019; on the official SA-MP forum, *"My purpose posting in this thread is to make everyone aware that SA-MP development is coming to a close."*, will no longer provides updates for SA-MP, maybe only just security updates, I/We don't know. Yes, I know it's still have no rights using it, but you be the judge of that.

2. **Will SAMPE compatible with any official SA-MP version?**
	No, and never will be compatible, atleast you cannot connect to any SA-MP server with SAMPE client and vice versa. It's a completely different version, just like the other SA-MP 0.3a to 0.3x versions. But the SA-MP server browser, RCON, SA:MP Debug program still can be used, on the server side Pawn is still the default inbuilt scripting language, and still can execute announce module to be seen on the official server lists.

	If you're looking for compatibility with great interface and functions, you should check out OPEN.MP! https://www.open.mp/

3. **Is this have all the SA-MP features from 0.3a to 0.3.7?**
	Eventually all SA-MP functions will be ported to SAMPE, some of them already implemented like SetVehicleParamsCarDoors(), or SetVehicleParamsCarWindows() which was added in 0.3.7 officially, but still not fully ported yet.

4. **So where I can download this?**
	SAMPE is still in development, slowly, but still. The first release actually planned when all SA-MP functions gets implemented to SAMPE, but may alpha releases slide out just for test purposes, but this plan could change anytime.
